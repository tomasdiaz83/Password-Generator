# Password Generator (Refactor)
Building a password generator utilizing code supplied by Bootcamp.

## Description

The password generator will, through window prompts, obtain criteria (length, alphabetic cases, numerics, and special characters) from a user that will be employed in creating a randomized password.

Limiting myself to window prompts, efforts were made to ensure a common-sense UI experience. This included explaining input errors and specifying their fix to the user while ensuring that "cancel" was treated as it appears - to cancel the generation currently going on.

## Installation and Usage
